            <h3 class="para2">The Football League 100 Legends is a list of 100 great association football players who played part or all of their professional career in English Football League and Premier League football. The players were selected in 1998 by a panel of
                journalists, including veteran reporter Bryon. The Football League also announced plans for a gala dinner later in the season at which surviving legends would receive a specially commissioned award.</h3>

            <h3 class="para2">The list includes 34 players who began their playing careers before the Second World War, 37 who began their careers between the end of the war and 1980, and 29 whose professional careers began after that date. At the time of the list's publication,
                six of the legends were still active, all playing in the Premier League. All 100 of the legends played in The Football League with the exception of Dennis Bergkamp, who did not begin playing in England until after the Premier League replaced
                the Football League as the highest level of the English football league system in 1992</h3>
